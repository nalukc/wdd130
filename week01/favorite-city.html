    <h1>Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My Favorite city is Hauula. More "town" than city this humble stretch of the east coast of Oahu invites all of
        your
        senses. Whether it is the scenic untouched shores against the deep blue oceans that delight your eye. The cool
        trade winds against your skin, or the smell and taste of the salt air brushing over the entirety of the town.
        You will know you have been invited by Hauula. She refuses the calamity of Waikiki and accepts the true island
        lifestyle. Good food, good people, and hard work.</p>

    <p>Even writing this my taste buds return to my childhood. Fresh fish from the reef, kalbi ribs at Papa Oles, or a
        musubi from Kaya store. The locals live in and run this town that seldom sees mega retail franchises setting up
        shop. The spirit of Aloha prevails and an old school type of neighborly trust is expected. Many may look over
        Hauula because of the way that it is perceived by the rest of the island. That's fine, the town would rather
        invite those who would come any way. The isolation from the rest of the island has a way of tearing a man down
        to what he truly is and reveals to him whether he is cut out to remain in this city.</p>
